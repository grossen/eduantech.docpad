In this post I'll be talking about my experience with switching from zsh (**Z** **sh**ell) to fish (**F**riendly **I**nteractive **sh**ell). I'm not gonna talk about how or why it's better than the other shells, I'm only gonna talk about the process of switching.

Where to start... well, how about starting with the fact that I tried to do the switch before? I did try to do the switch before, I don't remember exactly what problems I had last time but I'm pretty sure it was something with Vim or something.

I decided to try the switch again taking advantage of the fact that a new version had been released recently ([v2.1.0](http://fishshell.com/release_notes.html)). Seemed like a good idea to try again, also the fact that I like the features it has, of course.

The switch wasn't as problem-free as I wished but it was quite a smooth process.

First, I was running across problems with Vim which I imagine I wasn't able to solve last time, but I solved this time. The problem was a startup error that Vim was complaining about not finding a certain file or something. I just had to add the following to the top of my `.vimrc` file to fix it:

```none
if $SHELL =~ 'fish'
	set shell=/bin/sh
endif
```

Basically, if Vim can detect the `$SHELL` variable is `fish` it'll tell Vim to interact with the current shell as if it was `sh`. As I understand it, don't take my word for it, please. That fixed that.

Another problem I was running into was that Emacs was complaining about not being able to find the `package.el` file. The reason for the error was that I was opening an old version of Emacs (v22.x). This was just a matter of updating the `$PATH` variable, that was done with the following line of code in my `config.fish` file:

```none
set PATH /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/npm/bin /usr/local/opt/ruby/bin $HOME/bin $HOME/.tmuxifier/tmuxifier/bin $PATH
```

Umm... Those were the only real note-worthy parts. The rest were just a matter of translating zsh to fish. You can find the latest version of my config files here: <https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles/tree/master/config/fish>

If there's something you think could be said better or is plain wrong in this post feel free to [modify it](https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad/blob/master/src/render/posts/switching-from-zsh-to-fish.html.md) and make a pull request for it!
